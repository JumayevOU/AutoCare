# Security Checklist

This checklist should be applied during code reviews to ensure security best practices.

## Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Callback query data is validated before processing
- [ ] Location data is validated (coordinates within valid ranges)
- [ ] File uploads (if any) are validated for type and size

## Database Security
- [ ] All database queries use parameterized queries (✓ Already implemented with asyncpg)
- [ ] Database credentials are stored in environment variables (✓ Already implemented)
- [ ] Database connection strings do not expose credentials in logs
- [ ] SQL injection is prevented through proper query parameterization

## Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Bot token is stored securely in environment variables (✓ Already implemented)
- [ ] Admin commands are restricted to authorized users only
- [ ] User permissions are validated before sensitive operations
- [ ] API keys and secrets are never committed to source control

## Rate Limiting
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for message handlers
- [ ] Anti-flood protection is in place
- [ ] Throttling prevents abuse of bot commands
- [ ] DDoS protection is considered

## Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive user data is encrypted at rest (if applicable)
- [ ] Personal information is handled according to privacy regulations
- [ ] User data retention policies are defined and implemented
- [ ] Logs do not contain sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)

## Error Handling
- [ ] Error messages do not reveal sensitive system information
- [ ] Stack traces are logged securely, not shown to users
- [ ] Failed operations are logged for security monitoring
- [ ] Database connection errors are handled gracefully

## Code Quality
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys in code
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code follows principle of least privilege
- [ ] Nested ternary operators are avoided for readability

## Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Security-relevant events are logged
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are monitored
- [ ] Unusual activity patterns are detected
- [ ] Logs are stored securely and reviewed regularly

## Deployment Security
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured in production
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS (if required)
- [ ] Bot runs with minimal necessary permissions
- [ ] Production environment is separate from development

## Review Guidelines
When reviewing code, ensure:
1. All user inputs go through validation
2. Database queries are parameterized
3. Sensitive data is not logged
4. Error handling is proper and secure
5. Rate limiting is in place for user-facing endpoints
